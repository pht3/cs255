# CS 255 - Project Journal


### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a system that allow student drivers to schedule driving test sessions. The systme also allows internal users (admins) to manage customer data, scheduling, and add driving packages.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think what I did well was identifying the business requirements, limitations, and documentations.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise my gantt chart and make it a bit more detailed.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is very important to consider the needs of the user in the design because the user relies on the system to do the work and we are building the system for the users. I interpretted the user's needs by looking for keywords like "need" and "want" and work from there to write out the business requirements.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I start with interviewing the stakeholders and try to define what they need, what they want, and what can be done. I stay in constant communication with the stakeholders and send them any documentations they need to review. Constant communication helps keep the dev and stakeholders align and work out any issues right away. I also like providing as many graphs as possible to help provide a visual representation of the design. I learn that being able to describe requirements and systems in different ways helps people make connections between technical and non-technical people.
